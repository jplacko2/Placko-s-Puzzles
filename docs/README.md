# Documentation for my final project

#Placko's Puzzles:

## Notes

In order to run this project one must have cinder installed and built as well

Once the project runs, a ******"tools"****** menu will pop up with four buttons.  You can use the ******"find picture"******
button to search through your saved files for a picture you would like to use.  You may also drag and drop a picture
into the window to choose it.

The ******"shuffle"****** button in the tools window will break the picture into pieces and scatter them around the window.
It will also create a shaded rectangle which is where the pieces should be placed for the program to lock them 
in place.  You can use the mini view of the picture in the upper right corner as a guide for where each piece goes.

******To move the pieces******, simply click on the piece you want to move and then click on where you want to place it.
If a piece is roughly where it is supposed to go, it will lock into place and will no longer be movable.
You will be told when the puzzle is complete, so if you don't have a text displaying to tell you that, there are pieces 
out of place.

The button saying ****"switch to ____ mode"**** 
will do exactly that.  Puzzles in easy mode will have 5 to 10 pieces in 
each direction, and puzzles in hard mode will have 10 to 20 pieces in each direction, depending on the width and height 
of the picture. If you hit shuffle and the program only gives you one piece, it means that the chosen picture has awkward 
dimensions and it is suggested you find a different one.

Lastly, there is the ******"solve"****** button, which you can use if you give up on the puzzle to solve the puzzle. 
Clicking this button will erase any progress you had made on the puzzle, so be cautious before you do so.

Hopefully this guide helps you understand how to play Placko's Puzzles.
