#Placko's Puzzles

##Proposal:

This project will be building a program that allows the user to make puzzles like jigsaw puzzles out of their own pictures.
They will then have the opportunity to solve those puzzles for the grand prize of their own satisfaction.
There will be flexibility in the pictures used, and the amount of pieces in the puzzle.
The program will also be user friendly in that it will lock pieces in place when they are in the correct spot, so that the 
finished puzzle can look exactly like its supposed to.  Small additions may be added as well such as drag and drp for the
pictures and a fun message that pops up when you solve the puzzle.
